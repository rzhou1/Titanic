# Titanic: A complete solution - from EDA and feature engineering to prediction with both the first-level base models and the second-level stacking model

##This repo explores Titanic (kaggle competition) for predicting the survival of on-board passengers. It will start with exploratory data analysis, explore feature engineering, build base models and then introduce stacking for improving model performance.
